        <p>"A delicious potato side dish with fresh herbs and cheese. You can use any type of herbs you like. I prefer a mild cheese like Gruyere, but you can use Gouda or Emmenthal as well."</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds small potatoes, scrubbed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chervil</li>
            <li>2 bunches fresh chives, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 Â¼ cups shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.</li>

            <li>Peel potatoes and cut in half lengthwise. Place in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle with melted butter and season with coarse salt. Sprinkle with chervil and chives. Cover with
                Gruyere cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
