        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately
                with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
